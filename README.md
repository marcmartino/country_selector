I based this project off create-react-app and used react window, react portal, and use-http for off the shelf functionality while building the basics of the select component from scratch. I would have preferred to have customized react-select but it became quickly evident that that approach would be too time consuming.

to run the dev server run `yarn && yarn start`

to redeploy the app run `yarn deploy`
